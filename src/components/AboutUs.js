          <h1>Biography of Guan Gong </h1>
          <br />
          <h5>
            Guan Gong (A.D. 160 - A.D. 219), also known as Lord Guan, was a
            native of Shanxi Province. He was a man of enormous height, nine
            spans tall, with a sanguine complexion and a long, flowing beard.
            His stature was imposing, his bearing awe-inspiring. He was a great
            warrior and a man of noble spirit. In his youth, he pledged an oath
            of brotherhood with Liu Bei and Zhang Fei in the Peach Garden, an
            event that marked the beginning of his military career. His
            meritorious service won him fame as the leading warrior of the
            period of the Three Kingdoms. His exploits are still recounted in
            loving admiration even to this day.
          </h5>
          <br />
          <h5>
            By an imperial decree from Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty,
            temples and shrines dedicated to his memory began to be built
            throughout the empire. He also came to be honored by Buddhists as a
            Bodhisattva, by Taoists as God of Wealth and by Confucianists as God
            of War. Indeed, among the common people, so popular is he of all the
            Chinese divinities that, to this day, temples dedicated to his
            memory have never been short of worshippers making offerings of
            incense.
