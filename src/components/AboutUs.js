              Guan Gong (A.D. 160 - A.D. 219), also known as Lord Guan, was a
              native of Shanxi Province. He was a man of enormous height, nine
              spans tall, with a sanguine complexion and a long, flowing beard.
              His stature was imposing, his bearing awe-inspiring. He was a
              great warrior and a man of noble spirit. In his youth, he pledged
              an oath of brotherhood with Liu Bei and Zhang Fei in the Peach
              Garden, an event that marked the beginning of his military career.
              His meritorious service won him fame as the leading warrior of the
              period of the Three Kingdoms. His exploits are still recounted in
              loving admiration even to this day.

              By an imperial decree from Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty,
              temples and shrines dedicated to his memory began to be built
              throughout the empire. He also came to be honored by Buddhists as
              a Bodhisattva, by Taoists as God of Wealth and by Confucianists as
              God of War. Indeed, among the common people, so popular is he of
              all the Chinese divinities that, to this day, temples dedicated to
              his memory have never been short of worshippers making offerings
              of incense to Guan Gong as he is revered as the symbol of loyalty,
              righteousness, and bravery. Guan Gong has been credited with
              giving people strength, courage, perseverance and wealth.

              關公（公元160年-公元219年)，又稱關帝，是山西省人。他是個身材高大的人，膚色鮮亮，鬍鬚長而飄逸，身材氣勢磅，令人敬畏。他是一個偉大的戰士，也是一個高尚的人。在他年輕的時候，他就在桃園誓言與劉備和張飛結為兄弟，這一事件標誌著他的軍事生涯的開始。他的立功表現使他成為三國時期的主要戰士。直到今天，他的功績仍然令人欽佩。
